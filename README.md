this is a simple-ish website, built up from a foundation that used to be merely a placeholder page (which i have no git history for because i thought really far ahead :3)

eventually this will be built up with a custom backend (likely written in rust or go, whichever i have the most patience for ;p) to support all sorts of other fancy server-side features i want to eventually implement!
